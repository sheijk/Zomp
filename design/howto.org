* Zomp by example

** Tracing macro expansion steps

To see all macro expansion steps during compiling call
: zompc --trace-macros

In zompsh call this to see all macro expansion steps
: !traceMacros
and you will see macro expansion steps for 

Inside Zomp code use these macros to query/set printing of macro expansion:

#+begin_src zomp
std:compiler:setTraceMacroExpansion
std:compiler:getTraceMacroExpansion
#+end_src

Use 'zompc ... --dump-expanded-ast out.zomp' to write the expanded source code
to out.zomp. Do this for all zomp sources in the repository by passing the
command line argument DUMP_EXPANDED=1 to make/build.sh. Output files will end up
in foo.zomp.expanded.

To trace expansion of individual macros use mret instead of ret/return in the
body of the macro like this:

#+begin_src zomp
  macro dummy arg:
    mret $:
      print "Running code"
      ast:print(#arg, 2)
      println()
      #arg
    end
  end
#+end_src
