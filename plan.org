* Notes											:zomp:
- separated macro expansion / interpretation
- mutable variables
- loops
- metadata ( let @mutable x = 10 )
- support for operators (+, -, <<, etc.)
- compiler
- type system

** Type annotations
Annotate types using meta data?

let @type(int) x = 10

Use : as infix operator (: symbol type) as a macro name:

macro : symbol thetype = {
  @type(thetype) symbol
}

then:

let x :int = 10

** ; / expression separation
Let ; be an operator/macro?

print "1+1="; print 2;

=>

(op; (print "1+1=") (print 2))

;-macro evaluates each expression + returns value of the last one
(problem: requires macro expansion at run time. maybe instead create a sequence expression (evalseq (print "1+1=") (print 2)) and return that?)

Then monads are probably possible without expanding the syntax (and possibly even without any/too much runtime overhead because no closures need to be passed around)

** Type System
*** Composable type system
*** Security level
A variable a has an associated security level l(a). Writing a := b requires l(b) >= l(a).
Similarily, the relation of security levels between function's arguments and parameters can be declared.
Might allow to do flow analysis.
