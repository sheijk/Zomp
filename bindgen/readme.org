Bindings generator for C to Zomp.

This will generate Zomp declarations for C types and functions so they can be
used seamlessly.

To compile code that uses C libraries run zomp_bindgen_plugin.cpp (see make
files for details) on the C headers. Every type and function will be wrapped in
nativeTypedef/nativeFn/.. constructs. The library libs/native.zomp provides
default implementations you can use to expand them into declarations for Zomp
types and functions. You can also provide your own implementations for debugging
etc. by defining these macros before including the generated source.

To link just link your code and the object files or libs from the C code.
