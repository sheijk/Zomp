The Zomp test suite.

check_test.ml is the test runner. It's driven from testsuite.mk. Each source
file contains a bunch of requirements starting with "////" followed by a keyword
like error/warning/etc. The test runner will compile and run the test and check
the result against all requirements it found in the source.
